This repository demonstrates two common yet subtle issues in VBScript: late binding and implicit type conversion.  The `bug.vbs` file shows how late binding can lead to runtime errors when interacting with COM objects, and the `bugSolution.vbs` offers a more robust approach using early binding.  The second example highlights how VBScript's implicit type conversion can produce unexpected results, and how to address them using explicit type checking.
